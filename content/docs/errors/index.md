The "`mount: /mnt/EFIPartition: target is busy`" error can occur when you're trying to **unmount your EFI partition** but you aren't able to because of this error.

If you get the error, it means that you've probably left a **file manager window open** in that directory or you have some sort of **file or resource that is being used** at the moment of unmounting.

We already have a fix for this, so please be patient and **wait for the next release of LinuxEFIMounter**.
