LinuxEFIMounter is a simple and standalone Bash program that makes it easy to **mount the EFI partition** on your Hackintosh drive **directly from Linux**. It could be used to mount any EFI partition (also Windows and Linux ones) from a Linux environment, but its main purpose is to let you mount **your Hackintosh EFI partition without having to boot it**.
